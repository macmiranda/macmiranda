👋 Hi, I’m @macmiranda, a high-achieving generalist with 20+ years of experience managing highly-available distributed systems with focus on security. In other words, a problem solver in the hyperconverged world.

👀 I’m interested in Cloud Engineering, ML + Python, Automation tools (yes, even Power Automate), Threat Research and Blockchain technologies. I also watch a lot of documentaries and indie films. Nonfiction avid reader when my 👧 allows me.

🌱 I’m currently building up my Go skills and studying for the CKS exam.

🏆 Certified LFCS, CKA, CySA+ and CCNA
